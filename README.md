# WakeUp

This is a simple project that moves the mouse of every after some user-defined time interval to keep the computer awake. It was meant as an introduction into GUI Java. 

```Main.java``` is the codefile while ```WakeUp.jar``` is an executable file. Download it and run it to see the program in action.
